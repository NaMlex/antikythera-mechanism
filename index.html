        <h2>The mechanism</h2>
        <p class="main-text">The Antikythera mechanism is an Ancient Greek hand-powered orrery (model of the Solar System). 
            It is the oldest known example of an analogue computer. 
            It could be used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses decades in advance. 
            It could also be used to track the four-year cycle of athletic games similar to an Olympiad, 
            the cycle of the ancient Olympic Games.
            The artefact was among wreckage retrieved from a shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera in 1901. 
            In 1902, it was identified by archaeologist Valerios Stais as containing a gear. 
            The device, housed in the remains of a wooden-framed case of (uncertain) overall size, was found as one lump, later separated 
            into three main fragments which are now divided into 82 separate fragments after conservation efforts. Four of these fragments contain gears, 
            while inscriptions are found on many others. The largest gear is about 13 cm (5 in) in diameter and originally had 223 teeth. 
            All these fragments of the mechanism are kept at the National Archaeological Museum, Athens, along with reconstructions and replicas, 
            to demonstrate how it may have looked and worked.

        <h3>The origin</h3>
        <p class="main-text">The Antikythera mechanism is generally referred to as the first known analogue computer. 
            The quality and complexity of the mechanism's manufacture suggests it must have had undiscovered predecessors 
            during the Hellenistic period. Its construction relied on theories of astronomy and mathematics developed by Greek astronomers 
            during the second century BC, and it is estimated to have been built in the late second century or the early first century BC.
            The instrument is believed to have been designed and constructed by Hellenistic scientists and been variously dated to about 87 BC, 
            between 150 and 100 BC,or 205 BC. It must have been constructed before the shipwreck, which has been dated by multiple lines of evidence to 
            approximately 70 - 60 BC. In 2022 researchers proposed its initial calibration date, not construction date, could have been 23 December 178 BC. 
            Other experts propose 204 BC as a more likely calibration date. Machines with similar complexity did not appear again until the 14th century in western Europe.
